# Add-2-Numbers-by-User-Input

While running this program, First it will ask the "Enter first number:", We can enter like "18.45"

Next it will ask the "Enter second number:", We can enter like "88.29"

And it will show the output like "The sum of 18.45 and 88.29 is 106.74000000000001"


Thank you.
